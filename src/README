Common Mistakes
---------------
If configure claims Qt cannot be found, have a look at http://www.trolltech.com/
to get latest copy of Qt 4.4.x version.  If you have peeked there already,
grab the SVN module qt-copy from http://anonsvn.kde.org/, or a snapshot thereof.

Debugging
---------
You can use -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull with the cmake command script, if you
want to have debug code in your KDE apps and libs. We recommend to do this,
since this is alpha software and this makes debugging things a whole lot
easier.

More Info
---------
Please direct any bug reports to our bug list by visiting
http://bugs.kde.org/.
